My goal with this book is to paint an accurate representation of who I became in two years. The tricky part is, I really can’t even begin to explain the impact that my mission had on me. My perspective on life itself changed and looking back I can really see just how much different I have become. During the course of the two years, I tried my best to keep an updated journal. Some months were better than others. 

> As I read, I’ll add commentary like this to fill in any missing details, events, or funny stories.

My dad compiled his mission journal into a book, and I credit a lot of my motivation during my mission to what I felt as I read his experiences. My mission was far from what I thought it would be, that is to say, it was far different from what my dad experienced, but the impact that it had is something that I wish to express and capture in this book. To my kids who might be reading this, know that each persons’ experience is unique and personal. That’s the beauty of it. I might not be as talented a writer as my dad, but I hope that I can express how much this all means to me. If anything can be learned from my experiences, it’s that the Lord has so much in store for each of his children.
I really wish I could begin to explain just how much my life has changed because of that decision to serve. 

As I write this, I am engaged to marry the love of my life, to be sealed for eternity, something that never would have happened had I never left my home. I am getting a valuable education and working at a job I enjoy. I am active in the church and enjoy the stability and peace the gospel brings. In all honesty, most of the blessings and joys that I experience now can be traced back to that decision. I hope that by reading through my thoughts and experiences you will be able to get an idea of how much changed over the course of those two years.
