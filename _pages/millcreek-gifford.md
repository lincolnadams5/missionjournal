# Chapter 2
# Millcreek/Wilford/Valley View Stakes - Elder Gifford

## September 29, 2021

Well readers, here I am. Day 2 in <span class="custom-tooltip">el campo misional<span class="tooltip-text">the mission field</span></span>. I guess before I dive into anything I should start with yesterday. Tuesday morning was really tough. It was anxiety from the get-go and man was it hard to say bye to the siblings. I’m gonna miss them. Just writing this makes me want to cry. The drive to the airport was brutal. My hands were numb, my head was spinning, and for a while I really felt like I was going to die. It was such a scary feeling. Saying goodbye was so hard. I don’t really want to think or write about it right now. 
I didn’t puke. Yay! Major win for me. 

After the flight two AP’s named Elder Canty and Elder Uzell took us to the mission office where we had lunch (which I didn’t eat) and went over some logistical stuff and then we got back in the van and went to Ensign Peak. It was so pretty, and crazy to see the whole mission from one view.

> When I got to the Salt Lake airport I walked through those doors and a couple families who were waiting there for missionaries started to cheer, but stopped quickly when they realized I wasn’t their son. It was really funny but also sad because I was literally on my first day. 

We stayed at a hotel for the night. I stayed with Elder Kastner who will be a great missionary. He’s so focused. We had a good study/discussion. 

> I actually ended up running into this guy in one of my business pre-req classes about a year and a half after I got home. Really awesome guy.

This morning we “had” breakfast, (again, didn’t eat) and did some logistical stuff at the mission office and then met trainers! My trainer is Elder Gifford and I’m in the Valley View/Canyon Rim/Wilford Area in the Holladay Zone. Elder Gifford is a super nice guy. He’s from Kansas and was originally assigned to the Montevideo, Uruguay mission so he speaks Spanish! We went around and talked to a lot of people who I honestly can’t remember the day was just so overwhelming but right now I feel surprisingly at peace. 

> I was the first one to get called in the trainer meeting thing so we left right away. Elder Gifford was from Kansas and his driving abilities were really sketchy to say the least. He was very diligent and very stickler about the mission rules which I was annoyed with at the time but I ended up being very grateful for. He was definitely a quirky guy though. He didn’t own a pair of pants that got to his ankles. 

One thing I did want to write was about President and Sister Prier. They really touched me. In my first interview I mentioned my anxiety and how it’s hard to eat and stuff and he seemed to really care. And today, Sister Prier pointed me out saying Ecuador and President Prier asked me how I was doing, if I was hungry or anything and on my way out said, “It’s all gonna be all right.” They know me. They know me and the Savior knows me. They love and care about me. I have already felt some great miracles here in Salt Lake.

## September 30, 2021

Maybe I can do this. I really love talking to all the members, but maybe that’s because all the members in Utah are so nice. They are all such great missionaries too. Each one knows all their neighbors up and down the whole street and each is eager to talk about the gospel, it’s crazy.

I had a pretty tough morning. I was emotional and anxious when I woke up. It was pretty scary for a while. I was able to testify a little bit to one of Elder Gifford’s friends from Kansas named AJ about the comfort found in the gospel. For a moment, everything was quiet and it really felt good. Soon after all the anxious thoughts and feelings came back. Really shows the power of the Spirit. 

I need to eat more. I’ve been really struggling with that. When I’m anxious I have no appetite and if I do eat I have to burp so much and I feel near vomit. It’s tough.

> I remember in these first couple weeks I would just lay on my bed during the breaks in that tiny, musty bedroom and stare at the ceiling. It was pretty scary. Adjusting was really hard. 

## October 1, 2021

Pretty solid day today. We had district council so it was cool to see some other Elders. Elder Spangler was one hyper dude. Couldn’t stop bouncing or talking. Guess that energy is good for missionary work. 

We had some interesting visits today. I feel like I’m starting to find a groove talking to people, I just find it so fascinating to learn about them and their families. We talked to a couple people in Cherry Hills Apts today.

> Cherry Hills was such a weird place. The people there were so odd and the whole complex kind of gave me the heebie jeebies. Overall creepy vibes. 

Cindy is a lady with back problems waiting to get back surgery. She seemed pretty lonely and wanted to talk for a while. I was able to share a scripture, Alma 34:41 and try to invite her to watch conference tomorrow. She kinda brushed it off though. We got a call later that night saying a guy named Kevin wanted to meet with us as soon as possible. We got over there and turns out he was a member who couldn’t speak great English and he wanted a priesthood blessing. He didn’t say why. I offered the priesthood blessing and it was really pretty cool. I could tangibly feel the Spirit working through me. I can’t wait for more opportunities to feel that. So powerful. Also found out Kevin was from Taiwan and has traveled throughout the US and I couldn’t really figure out why. Very odd guy. Good day though. 

## October 2, 2021

I don’t know for sure but I think today was the first day I fully listened to all Saturday sessions of conference. It was actually really good. Definitely received a lot of good insights and came out of it highly motivated. I got pretty sad out of nowhere at lunchtime, missing home and feeling really inadequate, frustrated and scared so that was hard. I’m trying to remember that it’s just my first week. No need to freak out. I need to practice loving my companion better. Sometimes he’s annoying but I know he really just wants to do the best he can do which is good. 

We met with this cool family named the Gygi’s today. They were fun and made me feel loved so that’s always nice. 

## October 3, 2021

Conference is pretty cool. First time I’ve every watched every single talk. I definitely learned a lot and there is so much more to learn. We ate lunch at the Ward’s which was cool and very yummy. We taught a lesson at the Glad’s home tonight too. I felt like I was really able to connect. I just wish they could understand how important it is to let Christ all the way in, not just leave the door cracked. We also got food from the Cooper’s, always appreciated.

## October 4, 2021

Today was probably the best day out here so far. To be fair, it was a P-Day. I got to call Mom and Dad whilst trying to hold back tears but it was soooo good to talk to them and listen to their advice. In my patriarchal blessing there is a paragraph about heeding the counsel of my parents as I grow older. Every time I talk to them I see how that’s true. 

We got to play ball with some guys today too which was so fun. I also called the kids which was great. I miss all of them. We taught Saydee tonight. I think it went well, we’re planning on trying to set up a baptismal date next week. We also talked briefly to a family named the Booths who are all super into music. I got to play guitar and piano and stuff and talk about music. It was so fun. I can’t wait to go back.

> I loved the Booth’s because they would always let me play their guitar and mess around for a little bit. I think Elder Gifford would get annoyed that I wanted to play so much but it was so fun. Brother Booth would teach me stuff too, he was pretty good. Their whole family was musical. 

## October 5, 2021

Had an interesting experience today. We taught the Kellogg family a lesson about contention. It went well and at the end of the lesson Elder Gifford asked if he could pray in Spanish. At first, I was annoyed. Why would he pray in Spanish when literally no one speaks Spanish besides us? Turns out, the family’s daughter or someone (I don’t know the relation) came in at the end of the lesson and her boyfriend only speaks Spanish. I was humbled. I think that’ll be a lesson for my first part of my mission. I need to learn to be humble. 

## October 6, 2021

We had zone conference today. It was good, definitely motivated me and it was good to see other missionaries. Kinda struggled in the afternoon today though. We got turned down on doorsteps a lot and I was getting frustrated. We went and visited with the Dangerfields (who talk for eons) and ate their rolls during a zoom correlation meeting after which made me a little happier. I need to be more patient. Hard work + time = results. The time is the part I’m forgetting. Lots of things I need to work on. Dad also blessed me with some Tallest Man on Earth in my Google Drive so that was awesome.

> The mission rules surrounding music were pretty lax. It was really nice during that first part of my mission because it really made the bad days not so bad. It probably wasn’t the best policy for the rest of the mission though. Missionaries had these massive Google Drive folders full of music, some of which should definitely not be listened to by missionaries. The stuff I had was pretty lowkey for the most part, and I deleted all of it when I went to Ecuador. 

## October 7, 2021

Talked to some interesting people today. One was the Tuede family. They have three crazy little boys so it felt very comfortable to experience some of their chaos. We also talked to an older man, 86 years old, named Neil Kendall I think. It was kind of sad because his wife passed away a few years ago so he’s kind of alone and is thinking about death. At one point he said, “I don’t wanna die, but I guess everyone has to right?” That was sad. We also got caught up talking to the McBride’s far longer than we should’ve. Such a cool family though. 

I got really sad today. Missing home and normal stuff. I prayed individually for people, a real long, heartfelt prayer and it felt better. I’ve been pretty sad a lot so I guess I need to be praying a lot more.

## October 8, 2021

We had multi district council. It was pretty good. The guest speaker said something though. He said he saw in his mind’s eye the Savior suffering in the Garden of Gethsemane. I was filled with doubt and couldn’t shake it. Not sure why. I’ll probably talk to Dad about it. 
Also, looking forward to interviews with President Prier next week. Also I want to start studying examples of missionaries. Dad said I stand shoulder to shoulder with the likes of Alma, Aaron, Omner, Himni and many others. I want to study them. 

## October 9, 2021

Did exchanges with Elder Jensen and Elder Mari today. It was pretty fun actually. I went with Jensen. Real cool guy. He’s from Birmingham, Alabama, loves to be outside and work with his hands. Real funny too. It was good to see how other missionaries operate. We went to a ward party which was fun. I also got to play this sick guitar at a member’s house. Like it was magical. Buttery smooth. I think they said it was a koa wood Taylor. Not sure the model but it had a rounded cutoff for the top frets and I’m pretty sure it was an acoustic/electric hybrid. Anyways, future Lincoln, please buy that guitar. 

## October 10, 2021

Long day today. So much church. I bore my testimony in the Valley View 4th ward which was cool. Bro. Mike Christensen also gave us shoutouts from the podium and called us dynamite a few times which was cool. 

> Mike was the ward mission leader in that ward and was one of my favorites from my reassignment. He was really motivated and was crucial in helping us teach Saydee especially. He lived just around the corner from us too. 

We had a lesson with the Booths. So fun. He’s the guy with the guitars so I got to play for a while. Their family is so talented and sweet. Gifford also let me drive today which was great because he’s lowkey a super scary driver. I very much enjoyed driving though even if it was just for a little! 

> He was so scary. He would regularly jump the curb turning right and didn’t seem to understand the concept of slowing down into a turn so he would just whip it hard. 

## October 11, 2021

PDAY TODAY YAYYY! It was pretty good all around today. Talked to the parents, emailed/texted people and played ball. Not much more I could ask for. 

We had a great experience with Brother Christensen today. We weren’t able to meet with Saydee because she turned nine today but we talked with Brother Christensen for a while. It was honestly really spiritual. He said things that I had been thinking about. He had answers for questions I hadn’t asked. I felt really touched. It was cool.

## October 12, 2021

Got to spend the day with Elder Spangler. Dude is crazy. He’s got OCD and is definitely ADHD. It was good practice being patient though. He’s a good guy. I got to do some good studies today though. I’m tired.

> I remember this guy would always take off his socks in the house and run his hands through his toes. So gross. 

## October 13, 2021

Today I had exchanges with Elder Kelly. Such a good guy. We had a pretty adventurous day to say the least. It started with our Arby’s run for lunch (dad would be proud). We waited forever for Arby’s (of all places) because we had coupons and after we left, we realized we had the wrong food, and it was more than what we had paid for. So we had to wait forever in SLC traffic to get back and they actually ended up letting us take both our order and the wrong order. So we came back with 4x the original amount of Arby’s. This excess Arby’s did not sit well in Elder Kelly’s gut and we ended up having to find a church bathroom. 

I also went to Jackson’s house today but sadly he wasn’t there. I think I’ll try and set something up for the next exchange. I learned a lot from Elder Kelly today. I need to forget myself and go to work. I’m not that special. I need to talk to people on the street, in their cars, on their porches, wherever. I am an instrument in the Lord’s hands and through Him I can do anything. I hope I can figure out how to forget myself soon. I will definitely be working on it. 

> Elder Kelly was my zone leader and I ended up really admiring him for his diligence and work. I remember on this exchange we were walking a street pretty close to the University of Utah campus and there was a college student coming towards us. We had been working on this method of contacting called “The Golden Question” where we would ask the person a question to make them think and then bear testimony. So Elder Kelly, in an attempt to get me out of my missionary shell, had me contact this guy on the street, something that was pretty uncommon in Utah. I asked the kid what the word “atonement” meant to him and he gave me a pretty dictionary definition, to which I fervently bore my testimony. The guy goes, “Cool Elders, I just came from Institute and I have to go but I’ll see you around”. I had never felt so ready to get out of Utah.

## October 14, 2021

There really are no dull days on the mission. Today was the new missionary training meeting. It was pretty good. We went to go visit Carl today and I didn’t really have much of a plan but I wanted to listen to him and invite him to read the Book of Mormon. He’s into some weird thinking method, something about “the light and the sound” and he was talking about that and then out of nowhere, Giffy (Elder Gifford) goes, Bishop just called, we have to go. So we got out of there and he goes, “What are we even doing here?”. Apparently, he felt prompted to leave and he felt super uncomfortable. I was like “not cool bro” cus like that’s not cool to just dip during a visit. Granted it likely wasn’t going anywhere, but I was going to give the guy a Book of Mormon! Why is his prompting more important than mine? I was super annoyed. The little crazy thing that happened out of all of this was after we both kinda explained what happened to each other, I was still pretty annoyed. We were parked at a church and I was thinking about playing the piano because that sounded so relaxing. Anyways, about 15 minutes later he’s navigating and takes us to a church building and we walked in neither of us saying anything until he goes “go ahead, play the piano”. It was like he read my mind. It was wild. So I did, and it was very nice.

> I think I was more annoyed that I had someone that was calling the shots over me. That lesson really wasn’t going anywhere; that guy was so weird. 

## October 15, 2021

I gave a good training today on internalizing your purpose as a missionary. I think it went really well. I love teaching. It feels so good when you can really feel the Spirit in the room. Sadly we didn’t teach at all today. 3 appointments fell through. Lot’s of door and street contacting… which is hard. 

## October 16, 2021

Man today was lowkey weird dude. I was doing great on door contacting, feeling good. We had dinner with my boi Mike so that was good too. And then we went to go door contact the Coon family. Brother Coon was just getting home so we caught him and he invited us in and we chatted for a while. Then once we started to share a message he went on this rant for so so long about how he used to like the Book of Mormon but now its “fruits are sour”. He interpreted the story of Alma the Younger so horribly and false. He basically made Alma the Older to be an evil villain who was power hungry and Alma the Younger went to preach to the Lamanites to get away from his dad. It was wild. Giffey started crying after. He did not like hearing all that false doctrine. 

Then, this evening like 8:30, normally we would go visit members but Giffey said he had the feeling we should go visit this YSA girl that gave him a hug (beside the point), and I was like uhh okay. We go there and she doesn’t answer. Then he has the feeling we should knock apartment 14 and again no answer. Then he says we should pray about where to go and he stops mid-prayer and says we need to go home. Mans looked scared. It was only like 8:40 too, and Giffy never goes home early. We get back to our place, and he walks up and knocks Katie and Shauna’s door. Katie had a seizure earlier this week so we asked how she was doing and then Gifford offers to give her a blessing. So I guess we’re doing that tomorrow. I don’t know how I feel about these big wild goose chase vibes. It doesn’t seem right, it feels like he’s just doing the first thing to pop into his head which of course can be the Spirit, but it felt a little too weird. I don’t know. I’m accustomed to the Spirit working on a little more information. It all feels a little weird…

> This day was so so weird. I literally felt like I was chasing Elder Gifford around trying to get him to calm down and stay in one place. I almost felt like he was trying to make a pretty boring day more interesting. 

## October 17, 2021

Sundays are so long bro. Before the mission Sunday is the nap day, now it’s full of meetings, multiple churches, member meals and lots of work. I took a nap today which was nice. We gave our upstairs neighbor Katie a blessing too. It was good.

> Katie and Shauna were super awesome and friendly. They were a lesbian couple who lived above us in the duplex. We would often see them when we came home and I loved their wiener dog, Frankie. Frankie would run up to me whenever we came to the house and I would hold her. I became pretty good friends with Katie and Shauna too, they were super fun. 

## October 18, 2021

Another good pday. I realized my motivation for missionary work today. Right now I have a lot of doubts about myself and church stuff which makes me start to question why I’m out here serving. Each time I doubt, my mind goes back to Mom and Dad. If they feel so good about the Church and taught it to me and set such a good example with it for me all my life, then surely it must be true. While I definitely have foundational things in the gospel that are growing, this has been a great source of motivation for me. 

We had an awesome visit with the Hart family today. Sister Hart is a temple square orchestra violinist, Brother Hart is in the choir and literally all their kids are prodigies. They played for us and let me play for them, it was so so awesome. They were playing a piano accompanied violin piece and Giffy started crying.<span class="custom-tooltip">Fue muy divertido.<span class="tooltip-text">It was very funny.</span></span>

We also taught Saydee again today. Per usual, Mike basically led it which was great.

## October 19, 2021

Pretty boring day. I was super tired. That kind of made it bummy. Kind of not at all notable day. I want to sleep.

## October 20, 2021

Today was better. I felt much more motivated today and I think it started with my morning. Also, Elder Gifford has a very annoying habit of constantly turning the conversation on himself. There’s lots of little things that he does that I need to keep being patient with. Like his condescending remarks to my jokes. And his annoying face when he thinks he’s right. I need to be more patient. It’s not that bad. 

> One random thing about Elder Gifford was that I was convinced he was an actual robot. He refused to take naps during lunch on his bed so he would opt to sit straight up in his chair and fall asleep like that. He would set five minute alarms and just keep snoozing them like that too. 

## October 21, 2021

Another monotonous day. Lots of contacts, lots of rejections. The Ring doorbell rejections were my favorite. Also got to play guitar at the Booth’s for a bit. I’m learning a song called Horizons by the guitarist for genesis. 

## October 22, 2021

I want to go to Ecuador so bad bro. Also, today our McDonald’s must’ve been drugged or something cus we slept for so long after we ate from like 11:30 to 2 it was crazy. 

## October 23, 2021

Gonna be another short one tonight. I’m so tired man. Rick cancelled for the 4th time. We knocked on so so many doors that weren’t interested or hid from us. We did have dinner with the Thompson’s, the mom is from Ecuador so we spoke some Spanish. 

## October 24, 2021

Weird morning today. Firstly, we got our times mixed up and missed the ward we were supposed to speak in. Awkward. Then the power went out in nearly all of Millcreek. Then we spent an hour at the Garden Heights ward babysitting a crasy homeless guy named Karl. (I know it’s with a “K” because he told me so) He kept talking about the mafia, the matrix, and to be on the lookout for secret underground money schemes. Will do, Karl. 

## October 25, 2021

I’m so tired. We played basketball today. That was fun. It also rained a lot. Can’t wait to go to sleep. 

## October 26, 2021

I did exchanges with Elder Bushman today. It was good, I felt ready to lead the area. I think I was productive too. Maybe this missionary stuff isn’t so bad after all. 

> This day shifted my perspective a lot I think. It helped me to feel responsibility for the work I was doing there and not just rely on following Elder Gifford around. I remember it being a turning point. 

## October 27, 2021

Today felt eons long. I’m having a hard time trying not to get frustrated at all the little annoying things Elder Gifford does. Funny thing is that when I come back and read this, I might not even remember what they were. It’s so annoying that he explains everything like I’m five. 

> I don't.

We had a funny contact with a lady who said she was delivered from the Mormon church. She kept asking questions like do you believe this and this except everything she said was pretty basic stuff. Like we agreed on it all. Kinda funny. 

## October 28, 2021

Pretty decent day. Brother Bradley is such a dope dude. (Amen! Hallelujah!) Gives us Creamies all the time. Pretty dope. Hyped for transfers too, should be good.

> He was one of those guys that thought it was really funny to shout out "Amen!" and "Hallelujah!" at the end of sentences, especially when we were trying to be serious about something. The Creamies were hard to pass up though.

## October 29, 2021

My journal has been pretty doo doo buns as of recently so I’m going to try and step it up a bit. We’re kind of just plugging along trying to contact PMF’s and UBC’s all the time which is pretty tedious.

> We had these massive lists of part member familes (PMF) and unbaptized children (UBC) that we would systematically go through and knock their doors. I wouldn’t say it was the most effective but it was hard to find new people to teach in Utah. 

Halloween is this weekend so everyone is busy. I have exchanges with Elder Mariteragi tomorrow so that should be fun.

## October 30, 2021

Much needed day today. Elder Mari is dope. Such a cool guy. He’s from Hawaii, crazy good singer too. We jammed for a bit. While we didn’t get much work done it was very nice to be around a chill Elder for once. 

## October 31, 2021

Firstly I want to touch on something. Dad sent me an email about being obedient and it was a good reminder of why I am here. I’m not here to bend rules and mess around. Salvation is at stake. This is important work. Yesterday was fun but I don’t want to spend my mission doing that. It felt wrong. 

Today was good. Very tiring as Sunday’s usually are. I spoke in the Grandview 1st ward today and it went well I think. I talked about making Christ a treasure in our lives and kind of revolved the talk around “Where is your treasure?”. It was Halloween so it was kinda weird knocking doors but that’s okay. I led every contact with “trick or treat”. 

## November 1, 2021

I’ll never be a teenager ever again. 20 years old. That’s so weird. I’m getting old. Today was pretty lowkey, which is how I like my birthdays usually. We played a lot of basketball per usual. Elder Gifford asked me to give him a blessing today. I don’t know why. I think I’m going to work on loving my companion more this week.

## November 2, 2021

Quite a swell day today. Good studies, very productive day. I felt happy the whole time too. Goes to show how important a good morning start is. 

Had quite the fiasco trying to meal prep chicken today though. I think I didn’t put enough olive oil on the chicken so it started smoking like crazy and the smoke filled the whole house so I was worried the fire alarm would go off for a bit. The last chicken was lowkey undercooked too but I ate it anyways. Nothing a little Baby Ray’s can’t fix. Now the house smells like chicken so that’s both really weird and kind of nice. 

We had a great lesson with the Shafer’s too. Really felt led by the Spirit. I said the prayer in Spanish too because the mom is from Colombia. It went really well and the Spirit was very strong. 

> The chicken thing was so funny because all the dogs knew we smelled like chicken too. All the dogs were excited to see us without the chicken smell anyways, so you can imagine how they felt to see the missionaries smelling like a delicious barbecue. 

## November 3, 2021

Had a meeting with a guy who is Pentecostal. It was really cool, I was taking notes the whole time it was really cool. I felt like I was learning more from hearing other people answer his questions. Super cool. We also got a referral of a person who already set a baptism date for their son. We’ll see how that goes… 

## November 5, 2021

Wow I actually missed a day. That’s crazy. Maybe that means I’m getting used to the mission life. Yesterday we taught at the care center. I hate that place. I hate all the old people homes they smell so bad weird and they’re just kinda musty. Today we did a lot of contacts so that was pretty tedious. Hopefully I stay in this area because things are kind of popping off here. We had some random kid put himself on date and we have a lesson with Dylan Lolofie and the guy at the care center, David as well as a couple other potentials. 

## November 6, 2021

Today was pretty good. Played basketball, did service with our boy Hermano Watson, had great studies and argued with a “biblical Christian”. Super nice guy but really just wanted to challenge church teachings. Next week I start my 5 weeks of getting swollen. I’m gonna stick with it and get big.

> David Watson is such a kind guy. He was a ward mission leader and taught Spanish to the mission. He and I had a particularly good friendship and I still am in contact with him to this day.

## November 7, 2021

Dang bro. Today was so eventful. Fast Sunday so we bore testimonies. First things first, Giffy is getting transferred! Transfers are such a weird mix of emotions. I’m super excited, kind of relieved, but also nervous. I’m gonna have to take control of the area so I’m excited for that. Today our area kind of popped off. We taught our first lesson with Dylan, with Hermana Tullis and her comps on facetime. It was really good. Dylan seems really open and humble. David at the care center is also on date for the 20th. Things are really moving. I’m excited for a new comp though. That should be fun. Jeez. So crazy. We also got a ton of chicken from the Johnson’s so that’s hype. 

## November 8, 2021

I am so incredibly tired. We played basketball nearly all day which was great. We also had a baptismal interview with Saydee. She’s awesome. We asked her who she wanted to say the prayer and she pointed at me and said “Lincoln!”. It caught me off guard because I haven’t heard my first name in a while. But so cute. She knows it because she has a hamster (or rabbit I can’t remember) she named Lincoln. They’re so awesome. I really hope she is able to be baptized. She is so prepared. 

## November 9, 2021

Last day with Giffy in the books. We had cute goodbyes with Hermano Watson, the Bradley’s, Jeppson’s and the Owens. We also taught a great lesson to the Shafer’s. They’re such a good family. I also held a snake today. My new comp is Elder Ruggieri and I’m meeting him tomorrow so that’ll be good. I’m excited/anxious but I think that’s good.
