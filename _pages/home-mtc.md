# Pre-MTC

> I guess I should start with everything that happened before I even started the MTC. I got my call in May. I was working out with Matthew and Tyler in the garage when the text came in. It was a surreal moment. I remember that we played the one song that’s in Nacho Libre and jumped around celebrating. After they left, I opened the call with just my family. My heart was pounding out of my chest, but once I read the place, it all felt right. I couldn’t even pronounce the name of the city, Guayaquil. It was a special moment. 

> That summer was spent working for Chick-fil-a and hanging out with the boys. We took a trip to Oceanside together and stayed in an Airbnb, which was certainly the highlight of the summer. 

> I was endowed about a week before I started the MTC, on August 7th. Grandma and Grandpa Risenmay were there, as well as Jason and Chrissie Brown and some others from the ward. I don’t remember too much from the actual endowment day. Nate came out for my farewell talk that next Sunday. Kiki and Bunda were there for me to get set apart that same day as well. That day was really exciting and fun with all of the festivities. I was so excited to wear my nametag and my white shirts.

## August 17, 2021

First full day of the MTC in the books. Man these days feel long. It is crazy how Zoom can make you so tired. Today I was trying to watch a devotional and eventually decided to take off my shoes and sleep on the concrete floor. One of the best naps I’ve ever had.

> This first day was so hard. I’ve known that I experience anxiety around big life events my whole life. The first day of school, big social events, and other times like that always brought panic attacks, throwing up and anxiousness. Just before I was supposed to take the stand for my farewell talk (which I gave the day before this) I was in my dad’s office trying to get myself to throw up in an attempt to feel less anxious. The morning of my first day of MTC was worse. I remember sitting there in my dad’s office unable to breathe or feel my hands. My vision would get really blurred and everything would start to spin. Looking back, it’s interesting to see how much that has changed. I’ll talk about this struggle a lot during the course of my mission. It was definitely one of those “crosses to bear”. 

Definitely feeling apprehensive about everything and adjusting to missionary life is really hard but today I had some real spiritual moments that reminded me why I’m doing what I’m doing. I know that God loves me and is proud of me but I need to press forward and try to be the best missionary I can be. I need to strengthen my faith and invite the Spirit more into my life to comfort and guide me. All this anxiety is the worst I’ve felt ever, but I just know that the adversary is trying to pull me away and make me fearful. With faith and obedience I know that I can endure to the end.

Today was a good day. It was a long, long one, but a good one. I’m starting to get more and more excited about learning Spanish and preaching the gospel. I know that there are people set apart for me to teach. When I read the Book of Mormon in Spanish I’m starting to get glimpses of my potential as a missionary. I know that I have an awesome responsibility to do a lot of good. I am very grateful for it. I am thankful for this gospel and the happiness that it brings me. Like Lehi in the tree of life, I just want to share all of that with others.

Week 1 of the CCM (Centro de Capacitación Misional = the MTC) is in the books! They say that during the mission the days are long but the weeks are short, but right now everything feels long. It probably has something to do with sitting in front of a computer for 7-8 hours a day.

> The MTC days usually consisted of two 3 hour classes with my district, a huge workshop call, and designated companion study time. All that time on Zoom got really old. You’d be surprised how tired you can get from just sitting there all day.

Just makes you real tired. It’s making me more excited to get to the field though. This is an important work and there are so many people who need this message. <span class="custom-tooltip">Me encanta Jesucristo y su Evangelio!<span class="tooltip-text">I'm trying to say, "I love Jesus Christ and His Gospel", but my grammar is wrong…</span></span>

Today was a good day. I played the organ in sacrament meeting and it went well, I actually enjoyed playing. Said goodbye to Tyler for 3 years most likely yesterday. I was sad but almost happy. Not because I don’t wanna see him, I’m gonna miss him a lot, but we’re both going on to do some good things and become better people. I told Dad it reminded me of the sons of Mosiah leaving each other. Just can’t wait for our “joyful meeting” once we return. 

> This was a sweet moment with Tyler. It was really weird to say goodbye knowing that it would be so long. He’s a good dude and was always a good example to me in high school. As I write this he has about a month left before he comes home. I also remember how that scripture in Mosiah meant a lot and it was something that I thought a lot about during my mission too. 

I also gave a talk in our stake priesthood meeting today. It went okay but I felt like I was a little bit rambly and ended up saying the same thing a lot. I talked about faith but I don’t think I prepared my thoughts enough or allowed the Spirit to guide me. Good things to remember for next time…

Got reassigned (temporarily hopefully) today! Salt Lake City, Utah babyyyy. Didn’t really know how to react at first but the more I think about it, it’s really a blessing. Lots of support, familiar area; really seems like a good place to get comfortable preaching the word. Seems like there is a good amount of Hispanics there too so hopefully I will get to practice some Spanish. Only problem is that I have 2 long sleeve shirts but I can’t be mad to get some more clothes. Should be good.

> If you can’t tell from this journal entry void of emotion, I was not too excited to get reassigned to Salt Lake City. I took comfort in the fact that I knew the area and it was familiar, but it was hard not to be disappointed to fly back to Utah. In retrospect, this reassignment was so perfect for my personal growth and my adjustment to the mission field. It was easier to manage my anxiety in a place that I knew. But once again, it’s Utah, and who could really be excited about flying to Utah instead of Ecuador?

Oh hello again Mr. Journal. Almost done with week 2 of the CCM. I can’t wait to get out into the field and teach some real people. Zoom gets very tiring. My daily life consisted of waking up at 6:30, going with Dad to his office and sitting there in the meeting room playing with Legos during my Zoom calls. During the breaks I would ride the segway around or hit foam golf balls. It got pretty repetitive after a bit. My Spanish is coming along and I’m trying harder to memorize things and to use my Spanish whenever I can. Definitely gets better the more I put it into practice. Went to the temple today also for Camylle’s endowment. She’ll do great things in Brazil or wherever she ends up in the meantime. This gospel is so true and the more I study and spend time thinking about it, the more I can see how it blesses lives. <span class="custom-tooltip">La gente del mundo necesitan escuchar este gran mensaje!<span class="tooltip-text">The people of the world need to hear this great message!</span></span>

Long day today but a good one. I got to go “ride along” with the local missionaries. It really opened my eyes as to what I’ll really be doing for the next two years. We started by knocking on some prior investigators’ doors to see if they might be interested in hearing a message. It was really cool to get a tiny glimpse into the lives of these people I would otherwise never talk to. 

> I also remember thinking, “Holy crap, all I am going to do is knock doors of people that don’t want to talk to me all day.” I was scared. 

We talked to Elder Curtis’ mom’s cousin who was very interested in religion. It was really cool to see how religion is such a big part of their lives. They were 7th Day Adventists so we spent a majority of the time talking about kind of menial doctrinal points in the Bible. I felt like I was kind of struggling to find a way to contribute so as it was starting to turn into more of a Bible bash I just bore testimony of how the BoM testifies of Christ. I think the key in those situations is to realize that your words alone won’t change their mind most of the time. However, the Spirit has the power to change hearts. It will definitely be my most powerful tool on the mission, so long as I am worthy to wield it!

## August 29, 2021

Good Sunday. Mom got home today too so this week will kind of go back to “normal”. I’m so ready to get out of the MTC. I’m getting so tired staring at a computer all day. I have to be better motivated. We’ll see how anxious I am on week 6 though… 

## August 31, 2021

It’s been two kinda crap days so I probably won’t write much but I realized something just now. I am a missionary. I represent Jesus Christ. These two years already started and I can’t waste any time. I need to make sure that I am working hard enough to learn Spanish, preach the gospel and be a good, faithful missionary. <span class="custom-tooltip">Dos años no es mucho tiempo. Eso es todo.<span class="tooltip-text">Two years isn’t a lot of time. That’s it.</span></span>
