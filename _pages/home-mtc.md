# Pre-MTC

> I guess I should start with everything that happened before I even started the MTC. I got my call in May. I was working out with Matthew and Tyler in the garage when the text came in. It was a surreal moment. I remember that we played the one song that’s in Nacho Libre and jumped around celebrating. After they left, I opened the call with just my family. My heart was pounding out of my chest, but once I read the place, it all felt right. I couldn’t even pronounce the name of the city, Guayaquil. It was a special moment. 

> That summer was spent working for Chick-fil-a and hanging out with the boys. We took a trip to Oceanside together and stayed in an Airbnb, which was certainly the highlight of the summer. 

> I was endowed about a week before I started the MTC, on August 7th. Grandma and Grandpa Risenmay were there, as well as Jason and Chrissie Brown and some others from the ward. I don’t remember too much from the actual endowment day. Nate came out for my farewell talk that next Sunday. Kiki and Bunda were there for me to get set apart that same day as well. That day was really exciting and fun with all of the festivities. I was so excited to wear my nametag and my white shirts.

# Home-MTC

## August 17th, 2021

First full day of the MTC in the books. Man these days feel long. It is crazy how Zoom can make you so tired. Today I was trying to watch a devotional and eventually decided to take off my shoes and sleep on the concrete floor. One of the best naps I’ve ever had.

> This first day was so hard. I’ve known that I experience anxiety around big life events my whole life. The first day of school, big social events, and other times like that always brought panic attacks, throwing up and anxiousness. Just before I was supposed to take the stand for my farewell talk (which I gave the day before this) I was in my dad’s office trying to get myself to throw up in an attempt to feel less anxious. The morning of my first day of MTC was worse. I remember sitting there in my dad’s office unable to breathe or feel my hands. My vision would get really blurred and everything would start to spin. Looking back, it’s interesting to see how much that has changed. I’ll talk about this struggle a lot during the course of my mission. It was definitely one of those “crosses to bear”. 

Definitely feeling apprehensive about everything and adjusting to missionary life is really hard but today I had some real spiritual moments that reminded me why I’m doing what I’m doing. I know that God loves me and is proud of me but I need to press forward and try to be the best missionary I can be. I need to strengthen my faith and invite the Spirit more into my life to comfort and guide me. All this anxiety is the worst I’ve felt ever, but I just know that the adversary is trying to pull me away and make me fearful. With faith and obedience I know that I can endure to the end.

Today was a good day. It was a long, long one, but a good one. I’m starting to get more and more excited about learning Spanish and preaching the gospel. I know that there are people set apart for me to teach. When I read the Book of Mormon in Spanish I’m starting to get glimpses of my potential as a missionary. I know that I have an awesome responsibility to do a lot of good. I am very grateful for it. I am thankful for this gospel and the happiness that it brings me. Like Lehi in the tree of life, I just want to share all of that with others.
