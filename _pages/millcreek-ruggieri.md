# Millcreek/Wilford/Valley View Stakes - Elder Ruggieri

## November 10, 2021

Change is always so hard for me and I can’t figure out why. Maybe it’s because it is hard to regulate. I don’t know. I had my first day with Elder Ruggieri today. It’s different. He’s great at talking to people but not nearly as spiritual and it’s hard to feel guided when I’m with him. I need to figure out how I can make this my mission. I need to learn to make decisions for myself and to be okay with what people think. Ruggieri is good in some ways and bad in others, just like Giffy. 

## November 11, 2021

Today turned out pretty good. I think I know how to do this with Elder Ruggieri. I just need to set expectations early. He reminds me of if Tanner decided to serve a mission, pretty self-centered, kind of shallow, but has no fear when talking to people. I’ve been able to connect with him on some things pre-mission life. We are going to work hard though. I’m going to have to be the one to push it. Right now, he’s reading me “high thoughts” from the internet. They’re so stupid. But he likes it. I guess this is how the next 5 weeks will be. I’m ready to work regardless. We met with Anthony Drage today, hopefully we can set an earlier baptismal date than January but we’ll see. 

> Tanner was sort of like that in high school but definitely not like that anymore. He caught an unfortunate stray from me there…

## November 12, 2021

Quite the eventful day today. We had district council which was interesting with our sort-of new district. Spangler is district leader so it is certainly always interesting with him at the helm. Reggie is turning out to be quite the character (as if he wasn’t already). He got three aggressive’s today which really made him angry and sent him over the edge. He was already complaining about headaches and then the aggressive’s really made him mad. We stopped so I could go to the bathroom (really so he could calm down) and after that I drove. I don’t think he’s said a word to me since. This will be an interesting transfer for sure… 

> Each of the mission vehicles comes equipped with a driver monitoring system called “TIWI”. TIWI tracks who is driving, their speed, and any aggressive driving maneuvers that it catches. The office missionary couples are in charge of suspending or revoking the license of any missionaries that violate Tiwi rules too much. I can’t remember exactly but I think it was 5 aggressive’s and you lose your license. Elder Ruggieri already had 1 when I met him and so these three put him really close to the edge. He would always talk about how much he loved cars and so being in a driving area really got him excited. He was in a bike area for the better part of his mission up until that point so you can imagine how hyped he was. Too bad he drove like a psycho. 

## November 13, 2021

Man another day today. We helped Shauna and Katie put up a basketball hoop which was cool. Got some really great contacts and I didn’t punch Reggie in the face. He’s brutal. Like Tanner and Ryan combined as a missionary. He’s just so annoying. I’m grateful for the fact that I’m learning to be patient. We spent some time with Katie and Shauna playing basketball outside and just talking. They’re super great people. Frankie is awesome too, I held her for like half an hour. Best wiener dog ever. I need to make sure I keep working hard and pushing even when no one is pushing me. It’s hard but I’m learning. I feel like I’m dragging Reggie along. I’ve been having some really great personal studies though which has been doing me wonders.

## November 14, 2021

This is gonna be such a long transfer. I’m really trying to be an obedient missionary but it’s just so difficult with this companion. He’s like showing me memes while I’m driving around, on his phone during visits, and is more worried about telling people that his dad is a general surgeon than actually doing missionary work. And he calls me buddy. That might be the worst part. I’m going to really enjoy the temple trip on Tuesday. I think I need to bring something up to him. State up front that I want to be obedient and that I need to him to help me with that. I miss my family. I miss living with people I enjoy. But I also want people to feel the joy that I’ve felt from the gospel. I want them to feel the steadiness that comes from coming unto Christ. Man. I’m so tired. 

## November 15, 2021

Kind of a meh day today. Got the plumbing fixed (again) so that’s hype. Our lessons were kind of average. Saydee wasn’t even at the lesson at the Waite’s today. Need to pray to know what to do about her. Good thing we’re going to the temple tomorrow. Hoping I can find some answers. 

## November 17, 2021

Actually a decent couple days. I talked to Mom and Dad which helped a ton with everything going on. The temple was great too. The interview with President was fire today too. I came prepared with what I wanted to tell him and he had some great insight. I’m feeling much more hopeful. This dude is still annoying as balls, but I’m trying to learn to love him. Good practice for when I choose an eternal companion, says President. As long as my eternal companion doesn’t tell everyone she sees about drift cars I should be good to go. I’m trying to learn what the Holy Ghost specifically feels like for me this transfer. I think I have an idea of how to figure it out, so we’re working on it. Day by day. 

## November 18, 2021

Today was absolutely fuego! First, I’m going to Orem on Saturday to sign papers for my Visa, so that’s hype. Second, we had a great lesson with David and got everything schedule for him to be baptized on the 27th. I love that guy. We also put Saydee on date. Amy seemed good about setting December 4th as the date and so we’re planning on that now. She also said that she might want me to baptize her, which I would be so honored to do. Also, the lesson with Dylan today was awesome. She’s amazing and so open and curious. The lesson was really spirit filled and just such a good experience. Missionary work makes me very happy and very sad sometimes dude it’s crazy. 

## November 19, 2021

Decent day today. We had multi (Multi-Zone Conference, like a district council but bigger) and did some housing elders stuff. We talked to some good people tonight which is always good. I will definitely need to come back and visit Mike and Saydee and her family, they’re awesome. Sister Prier told me my tentative date for Ecuador is December 13th, I’m so hyped. 

> They would have elders go and help move things around in different apartments every once in a while, called housing elders. Like moving guys essentially, but it was fun to break up the day-to-day grind.

## November 21, 2021

Yesterday I signed Visa papers! I’m so hyped to go. We gave talks today in church and that was great. I really felt good about what I said. I talked a lot about our eternal treasures. Definitely a talk I will use again. We had some great lessons today too. We had a good one with the Thorums talking about the Holy Ghost. We also had an absolute fire lesson with Dylan. The spirit was so strong. I’m so happy for her and I’m going to be sad when I leave. 

## November 22, 2021

Wow, did not think I was having a birthday party 3 weeks after my birthday but I guess I just did. Honestly, the best part of my mission so far. We taught our usual Monday lesson at the Waite’s and then they said they were doing a closing song, then of course came “Happy birthday…”. I guess they caught on that I mentioned in my talk how I enjoyed my mission birthday because no one knew. They had cake and ice cream and everything. Saydee, Addyson and Amy even got me gifts. Saydee gave me a big hug. It was so cute. I’m gonna come visit them after the mission for sure. Man, I really felt loved tonight. It was really special. I told my comp, I’m just glad I’ve been at least able to see a positive influence in these awesome people’s lives. I’m very blessed. 

## November 23, 2021

Today was actually a really good day. I have really grown to love Elder Spangler. I had exchanges him today and it was honestly great. He’s such a happy, cheery guy. And he’s funny too. Great break from Elder Ruggieri. At the end of our last appointment we were walking out and Spangler just starts walking up their stairs towards the bedrooms. I was dying laughing. He thought that was the exit I guess but it had to have been the hardest I’ve laughed in a while. It was so funny. We also talked to Katie and Shauna for a while during lunch. I just held Frankie the whole time it was adorable. I love that wiener dog. Definitely will visit Katie and Shauna after the mission.

## November 24, 2021

I got my flight plans!! I’m going to Ecuador!! LET’S GOOOOO! I’m so hyped. It’s gonna be wild. I leave December 14th. Sooooo hype. 

## November 25, 2021

Good Thanksgiving today. We played football with a bunch of elders and it was pretty fun. We spent the rest of the day at Mike’s, eating food and calling family. I miss my family. 

> When we played football, Elder Ruggieri wore these track pants that were for sure too small. Like those track pants were wayyy too tight. All of the elders were making fun of him. I also remember him getting trucked in that football game at some point. Elder Ruggieri had quite the reputation of being annoying in the mission so a lot of elders had it out for him. 

## November 28, 2021

Sundays are always crazy. It was a good crazy today though. Saydee wants me to baptize her for sure now! I’m so hyped. It’s gonna be great. I feel so honored. 2 weeks till Ecuador too! Last night Sister Thompson dropped off tons of food for us and left this note.

> In Spanish the note read: “For the elders who are always hungry. We love you!” 

The people here are so great. Yesterday we also had a fire dinner with Brother Vargas and his girlfriend Liz. He’s dope, I’m gonna make sure to go talk to him before I leave, he’s so dope. He also said he’d take me to Powder Mt. when I get back to snowboard. People here are so dope. 

> All I remember about this guy was that he was really young, his girlfriend was really attractive, and his house was super modern and nice. I think we all kind of envied that guy.

## November 30, 2021

Pday was good, played football with the Tongans which was hype. We’ve been having a lot of MM’s (member messages) recently which is very good but very tiring. We talked with the Shafer’s again today. They’re such a good family. Brother Shafer shared some real personal stuff with us and I just feel like I’ve really been able to connect with this family which is awesome. I need to work on loving my comp better. It’s hard a lot of the time. 

## December 1, 2021

Fantastic zone conference today. I really felt the Spirit. It was thicc. Kenneth Cope sang and spoke poems and then Elder and Sister Pearson gave talks. Saw Giffy there too. Also saw some boys from the first day. Weird I won’t see them again. 

I nearly fought Reg today too. Katie is in the hospital again for what the doctors think is pancreatis. We were talking to Shauna and she was really broken up about it. Shauna has been having her own problems too so it sounds like everything is kind of piling up. I felt really sad for them. We offered blessings for them so I think we’ll do that Saturday. Anyways, we go inside and Reggie goes, “I wouldn’t be surprised if she has total organ failure and it results in death.” I totally snapped at him. It was so messed up. What kind of psycho says something like that?! Like dude, that’s so bad. Man I want to beat this dude but I need to love him. It’s so hard. 

## December 5, 2021

Wow… what a day. I have been bad about writing so I have some stuff to catch up on. Thursday was fine, kind boring. I’ve really been enjoying my studies though. I have two new books, Jesus the Christ and The Infinite Atonement. They’ve really been eye-opening. I’m definitely learning to love the Savior more.

I had an exchange on Friday with Elder Bushman. Love that guy. He’s very “go with the flow”, anti-conflict type of guy. I got to play this dope pipe organ that day too. Liz Hare was right about a real organ. It was lit.

> Liz Hare was the organist in my home ward and would always tell me how great real organs are as opposed to the electric organs that they have in most churches. 

Saturday we helped this guy in Bushman’s area move and then he DoorDashed us pizza so that was pretty hype. Semi-unproductive day but that’s okay. 

Today was tiring, amazing, long, but I was on Cloud 9 the whole day. We attended various wards, including a Wilford stake conference from 9-11, with 12-1 being the Highland View ward with Dylan. It was nice. I always look forward to taking the sacrament. It has certainly brought on more meaning on my mission. I was fasting today too, and to break my fast I ate like 30-40 chicken nuggets since we didn’t have a member meal today. We weren’t able to have the Thorum’s lesson but we talked to Melanie briefly about how she was sad she didn’t believe in life after death. I think we needed to be there for that. 

Most importantly we had Saydee’s baptism! Wow, I was so nervous. Saydee and I were arguing over who was more nervous. Brother Bauman was conducting and asked Saydee who is baptizing you today? She goes, “Lincoln! … I mean, Elder Adams!” It was so cute. I knew it was coming though. The baptism itself was amazing. I was so grateful to be able to take part in that day for her. I’m gonna miss all of them. Dylan came to the baptism with the Tullis’s too! Afterwards, Brother Tullis drove us in his Tesla Plaid drag race to our lesson and dude, that thing is fast. I talked with him more about going into his career and he said to come find him when I get back. I will definitely take him up on that. 

The lesson with Dylan was great too, it always is. She said she started crying on her way home last time. It is amazing to see the Spirit working through her. I’m so lucky. I’ve met so many amazing people. Man, I’m gonna miss this place. Also my hands hurts from writing. 

> Saydee’s baptism was so great. They had me play a piano solo as well as perform the ordinance of baptism so I felt pretty special. It was such a great experience. One thing I didn’t mention in my journal was that the water was so low that it didn’t even get past my knees. Saydee is so small that it was still pretty easy to baptize her.

> I haven’t really touched on Dylan yet. She was super kind. She was a senior in high school and a star tennis player. She got a full ride to Weber State I think. She was best friends with this girl, Bitsy Tullis, who was on a mission in Vegas. We would coordinate facetime calls together and then we ended up just teaching Dylan at Bitsy’s family’s house. They were really welcoming and kind. 

## December 6, 2021

What another good day. Highlight of every Monday is hanging out at the Waite’s home. I love all of those guys. Saydee and Addyson are the cutest. I will definitely be coming back to their ward. Saydee was so mad she found out I baptized my sister before and goes, “I wasn’t your first?!” It was hilarious. I love all of those people so much. 

## December 7, 2021

I did good today. I felt good because I was productive. Weird how that works… I am definitely learning patience this companionship. This dude is sooo annoying. I just keep repeating in my head, “Charity is long-suffering”, over and over again. That’s how I’m having charity for this guy. 

## December 8, 2021

Exchanges are blessings from heaven. After a long morning picking up meds and dealing with Reg, I was about to punch him in the mouth but I had an exchange with Elder Wagner today! It was truly a blessing. I feel like I learned so much today. I’m going to start setting better goals, talking to more people with less fear, and doing missionary work with a passion. I’m going to make this the best last week of transfer history. Wagner also showed me how fun and good missionary work can be. I’m going to try and give Elder Ruggieri one compliment everyday for the rest of the transfer. Charity suffereth long. I’m going to do just that. I’m not goingto let him take me down with him.

## December 9, 2021

Today we got snow! A lot of it too. Roads were a tad slippery. It’s funny because this weather is like the complete opposite of what it will be in Guayaquil. Had a great dinner at Olive Garden with Brother and Sister Watson. I love those guys. <span class="custom-tooltip">Mis abuelitos amables.<span class="tooltip-text">“My kind grandparents”.</span></span> I hope I continue meeting with him weekly over the course of my mission. He’s just such a sweet, loving guy. Also today during the member message, the only words Ruggieri spoke were, “Should we close with a prayer?”. So fun. Counting the days… 

## December 10, 2021

The feeling of leaving an area better than you found it is so good. We met with some new people today and just had an overall very good day. It dumped snow too so we were drifting in parking lots quite a bit. Bishop Child complimented me on how hard I worked in this area and obviously compliments isn’t why I work hard, but it felt very nice. I’m proud of the work I did here. That’s how I want to leave every area. 

## December 12 2021

Man what a happy day. I’m gonna miss the Tullis’s and Dylan. I really love those guys. I played a piano duet with Grandma Tullis Today! It was so cute. She said after that I should “marry Bitsy, but she has a boyfriend, but that’s okay.” It was hilarious. I’m definitely going to look into Brother Tullis’s career after the mission too. Man, I just have so many good people in my life. Besides my companion. He’s the worst. But I’ll miss these people.

## December 13, 2021

Said goodbye to the Waite’s and Saydee, Addyson and Amy today. Super sad and cute. Saydee gave me a big hug and started crying as I was leaving. It was so adorable. I’m gonna miss all of them. 

## December 14, 2021

Mostly packing today. Said goodbye to the Shafer’s. They’re such a cute family. Currently I’m sitting by the window listening to Coldplay watching the blizzard come down outside. And I have hot chocolate. It’s a vibe. 

## December 16, 2021

I am currently on the way to Atlanta right now, so I figured I should probably give an update as to everything that is happening. Yesterday was a super odd day. It absolutely dumped snow, like 14 inches or something, so President Prier ended up coming to pick up my Covid test. We dropped off my winter clothes with Grandma Tullis, copped some Chick-fil-a and headed to the mission office to pick up Reggie’s greenie. A greenie is a nickname for a new missionary. I feel bad for both of them. Reggie is a crap trainer and the greenie was lowkey sassy. Crazy part though, we were supposed to house an elder for the night and pick him up from the airport. Turns out it’s Garrett Sonnefeld from BYU! So wild. Garrett was in my ward my freshman year. He’s a super nice guy, he was the Elders Quorum President and would come over to our apartment every once in a while to get on our case about ministering. He was a really great missionary and really motivated. 

When we got back, that’s when the anxiety hit. We ate Taco Bell (bad idea…) and went to say goodbye to Mike. I threw up a couple times in his bathroom. Good stuff. Said goodbye to Brother Watson too. The cutest was that night, I held Frankie for like an hour and Shauna and Katie got me some presents. It was a little photo album of me and Frankie, their contact info (and their niece’s) and some Utah Jazz socks which I thought was funny.

> They were also very adamant about setting me up with their niece the whole time I was there. 

We left at 4:45 this morning. There’s probably like 30 missionaries on this plane, crazy.
