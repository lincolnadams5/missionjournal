# Chapter 4
# Barrio Ventura, Babahoyo, Ecuador - Elder Figueroa

## December 18, 2021

Whoa. Estoy en Ecuador. I am in Ecuador. Let me update on the past few days. We met up with a ton of missionaries in Atlanta and ended up in Quito for the night. We stayed at this crazy nice hotel and I got my own room for the first time which was weird/cool. 

> The hotel was not familiar with the “missionaries always need a companion” policy and gave every one of us our own room. Since we were supposed to have a connecting flight that night that we missed, everything was last minute. 

We woke up in the morning to catch the flight to Guayaquil at 9:30. I barely woke up in time, Elder Russell had to call me. Elder Abele unfortunately did not. He missed his flight so we had to leave him. 

> This part of the story definitely needs some explaining. Since we missed our connecting flight the night before, the airline put us up in a hotel for the night. There were two flights headed to Guayaquil that morning, one at like 6-something in the morning, and then there was mine at 9:30. Elder Abele was supposed to be on that earlier flight but slept through it. Naively, he thought he could just get on to ours, but since his ticket was not for that flight, the airline would not let him on. We were already running late and since we didn’t have our phones, we couldn’t let anyone know. We had to leave him in that airport for him to figure out how to Guayaquil. He showed up later that day after he was miraculously able to find a member of the Church in the Quito Airport that spoke English and could put him in contact with President. It really was a miracle because our Spanish was so so bad. We couldn’t understand a word of what anyone was saying to us. 

We arrived in Guayaquil, met the president and took a bus to the mission office. This place is crazy. It is so freakin hot dude. I’ve been sweaty since I got here and have only stopped when I take ice cold showers. We stayed in <span class="custom-tooltip">La Casa Verde<span class="tooltip-text">Literally means the Green House, it was the mission house closest to the office where the missionaries stayed sometimes.</span></span> for the night and woke up in the morning to meet our trainers. We spent most of that first day watching cars and wondering where the heck we are. 

> I remember that the first day we spent the whole day hanging out at the mission office while everyone interviewed with President. Some of the missionaries got to go out and do some proselyting with the closest missionaries but I never got that chance because our group was really big. I sat by the front of the church most of the day and watched the cars go by. It was a really surreal moment. At one point, a guy selling magazines tried to come up and talk to us and while we tried to talk to him back, we had to be rescued by some other missionaries because we didn’t have a clue what he was asking us. 

My <span class="custom-tooltip">compañero<span class="tooltip-text">companion</span></span> is Elder Figueroa! He’s from Quito and speaks only a tad of English, which is nice for quick translations. My area is Barrio Venturas in Babahoyo. We took a two hour bus ride out here and it feels like a really wide city in the middle of nowhere. I still don’t really have a clue where I am. We live with <span class="custom-tooltip">los asistentes<span class="tooltip-text">the assistants</span></span>, Elder Boswell and Elder Torres. They’re both dope and really easy going. Boswell has been comforting me with the struggles of adapting to a new culture. Someone told me I look like David Beckham today. That same guy worked at the grocery store that we would go to and called me a different, white soccer player the entire time I lived in Babahoyo. That was cool. We met as a district to practice a singing number which was fun. I played the piano. I love Spanish. I just want to learn man. People here are always smiling and always friendly.

## December 19, 2021

It is so freakin’ hot here bro. I am sweaty all the time. I learned today that chicloso means sticky. That is me. <span class="custom-tooltip">Yo estoy chicloso siempre.<span class="tooltip-text">I am sticky always.</span></span> We had church today which was fun. I love singing in Spanish. Everyone here says <span class="custom-tooltip">“chevere”<span class="tooltip-text">Cool</span></span> or <span class="custom-tooltip">“en serio”<span class="tooltip-text">Seriously?</span></span> all the time. It’s like every other word. I love it. Also, every taxi and a ton of cars here are Chevy Aveo’s. When we get in taxi’s it feels like home. 

> I drove a tiny little Chevy Aveo hatchback for a year in high school before it kicked the bucket. It was an iconic car and since the license place included the letters "TUG", we called him "Lil' Tug". 

We had a huge Christmas devotional today. I played the piano for the missionary choir. That was fun. We also talked with a bunch of members today. It is so tiring to try and translate in my head, I was nearly falling asleep, it’s just so taxing. Elder Figueroa is awesome, he’s patient with my questions, funny, easy-going, but hard-working. I need to be a missionary like him. 

Also, another crazy thing, a ton of houses here are on stilts because of the rain. We’re headed into rainy season too. Should be fun. 

> In Ecuador there are only two seasons since it is right on the equator. From December to about May, it is hot, muggy, and it rains all the time. All the other times of the year it is just hot. 

Also, I forgot to add. Apparently there has been some problems with missionaries here in the past. The bishop first told us that the last missionaries were doing bad things and he had to tell the stake president, who told the mission president. Elder Fig thinks it has to do with chastity. Then at the Christmas devotional, the ward secretary told us to be careful of women because something the last missionaries did. I don’t know what it was but it must have been bad. I keep referring to them as <span class="custom-tooltip">“los misioneros que estaban besando toda la gente”<span class="tooltip-text">The missionaries that were kissing everybody.</span></span>.

## December 20, 2021

Just like the beginning of the SLC mission, the days feel so long. I keep falling asleep during studies but I think it is because of jet lag. I tried a chicken foot today. It was weird. Fig ate the rest of my soup. It was like snotty lentils. Everyone really does feed you mountains of rice. 

We went to Palmar to find a member and get attacked by mosquitos, but we taught a good lesson and gave her kids blessings. We proceeded to a dangerous area to teach a lesson but I didn’t see anything there. Did some contacts and spent <span class="custom-tooltip">Noche de Hogar<span class="tooltip-text">Family Home Evening</span></span> at the Jordan’s house. They’re super nice, but incredibly hard to understand. Everyone here leaves the “s” off their words. Today was good but very long and tiring. I like it here though. I just need to get settled. I’m also starting to like the cold showers. Also, mangoes are fire here (all fruit basically). The juice is amazing. I had maracuya today. Everything here is different but I love it! 

## December 21, 2021

My goodness what a long day. I swear we walked like 10 miles. We had district council which was fun. I can see tender mercies happening for me here. The language is difficult, but the people are amazing. My comp is so awesome. He is patient with me as I ask a billion questions, works really hard, is happy and funny and I can tell he genuinely cares about me. I know that I am exactly where I need to be in the world right now. <span class="custom-tooltip">My companion es el major del mundo. Es muy chevere.<span class="tooltip-text">My companion is the best in the world. He’s very cool.</span></span>

## December 23, 2021

Okay, I missed a day so I have a lot to write. I’m gonna go highlight mode for this one.

Yesterday was P-Day, we played uno and ate encebollado as a district. After we went to a family Christmas party and played games with them. It was a game where you tie knots in a tie and race to catch the other tie. (I know that makes no sense).

Today I got flirted with a bunch (says Elder Fig, I don’t understand much). I tell people I am from the United States and they freak out. Some girls don’t even hide the fact that they stare. Gringos are like a TV show around here. We were doing a contact like this and giving fist bumps at the end and this girl just like grabbed my hand and was rubbing around it, so so weird. Elder Fig was dying.

We also played soccer in the cancha with a bunch of niños. It was so so so fun. I megged a kid too. We were sweating so much after. Like literally dripping. I also destroyed a member’s toilet.

We also lost the keys to our apartment today. So we had a nice dinner date waiting for the assistants to get home.

I love it here. It’s so hard but so good. <span class="custom-tooltip">Es la vida.<span class="tooltip-text">It's the life.</span></span> 

## December 25, 2021

Felix Navidad folks. Yesterday was hard. I felt frustrated with the language all day and had a hard time staying focused on understanding because it makes me so tired. Just like anything, I know I can do this, I just need to keep pushing. It’s just pretty depressing not being able to understand anybody. We ate Chinese food with la familia Jordan yesterday. That was nice. They ordered me a full mountain of rice and chicken and I could barely eat half. Last night we had <span class="custom-tooltip">“Noche de Chicos”<span class="tooltip-text">Boys Night</span></span> and played cards until midnight. We also put on these clay face skin mask things. (Boswell really likes them I guess). It was nice. I’ve been really tired this morning. I’m writing this in the morning. We had little stockings of candy which was fun. It’s just hard right now.

## December 26, 2021

Okay I gotta catch up a bit. Yesterday was a day of realizations. I was really frustrated with the language, missing home and stuff. We had a companionship study as a house and I ended crying a fair amount. I was bearing my testimony on how the Gospel is a gospel of comfort and read 3 Nephi 1. It was really spiritual. 

We taught a lady in La Marixa yesterday and it was really special. At first she was really stubborn and difficult, but as we got into the lesson, I could understand every word she said. It was amazing. Truly the gift of tongues. It ended up being a good teaching moment for me. 

Today we went to Montalvo with the squad to make visits. (<span class="custom-tooltip">Obispo Torres y su esposa<span class="tooltip-text">Bishop Torres and his wife</span></span>, Hermano Crespo, Hermano Fajardo, Hermana Guaspa) It was an adventure. I love Montalvo. It’s so cute. I think we’re going to try and make a branch there. I talked about this experience a lot with other missionaries. It was a real tender mercy for me. 

> The lady we taught that day was the Bishop’s wife’s sister. She wasn’t a member of the church and had some hard feelings towards us. I don’t remember anything about the lesson, other than the fact that I had no trouble finding the words to be able to express myself. I feel humbled just thinking about it. The Lord was showing me what was possible through my hard work and sacrifice.

## December 27, 2021

Pretty average day. I think I am adjusting to mission life little by little. I am certainly eating a lot more. I am determined to not give up during days. Sometimes I’ll get frustrated and stop speaking Spanish but I’m going to not do that this week. I feel determined to not waste these two years of my life. I want to work hard, it’s just a matter of making it happen. 

## December 28, 2021

Well, ladies and gentlemen… It happened. I crapped my pants as a missionary. I was always told it would happen but I never believed it. It was so bad. I have no idea what even caused it or how it happened. We had some great contacts today and my Spanish felt good today. We did eat a lot of food, but I didn’t think it was more than any other day. <span class="custom-tooltip">We had some jugo de naranjilla que estuvo rico<span class="tooltip-text">We had some orange juice that was delicious…</span></span>, and we were walking to a <span class="custom-tooltip">noche de hogar<span class="tooltip-text">family home evening</span></span> and it just erupted. Down my leg and everything. <span class="custom-tooltip">Sin invitación.<span class="tooltip-text">Without invitation.</span></span> I had to throw away my garment bottoms, pants and socks it was so bad. I even had to clean one shoe. <span class="custom-tooltip">Mucha menestra después también.<span class="tooltip-text">A lot of diarrhea after as well.</span></span> Jeez bro. 

> I still can’t believe this happened. Looking back on it, I’m pretty sure I got a parasite from the water. It was crazy. We turned the corner and then it was like the floodgates just opened. I stood their speechless as all of my insides and pride left my body into my pants. I looked at Figueroa and told him in my sad, broken Spanish, “We have to go, now!” He asked me what happened and I didn’t even have to say anything for him to figure it out. He asks me, “Sin invitación?”, which literally means, “without invitation”? Then he goes, “okay let’s get a taxi”. There was absolutely no way I was about to ruin some poor guy’s taxi and I told him, “I am going to destroy that taxi.” So we ended up walking the whole 2 miles back home. I tried to sinch my pant leg at my knee to stop the flow but it was to no avail. The damage had already been done. 

> I learned later that although all of our kitchen water faucets have water filters connected, there was a small black knob that had to be turned to activate the filtered water. The catch there was that this would cause the flow of the water to be significantly smaller. Being impatient and assuming they were all filtered, I would always opt for the larger water flow (unfiltered) and drink straight out of the faucet. I didn’t realize this until a week or so after. I think it made me stronger.

## December 29, 2021

<span class="custom-tooltip">Día de P.<span class="tooltip-text">Literally: "Day of P", or in other words, "P-Day".</span></span> Was a long night last night. Mom says I have food poisoning because I was pooping straight water all night and day. I think it’s slowing down now. I bought an Ecuador jersey today. That was cool. I still can’t believe I actually crapped my pants. Hopefully I’ll be good for tomorrow. 

## January 1, 2022

I was not good for tomorrow. Thursday was a long day. I. tried working out and studying but after another long night of waking every 30 minutes to empty my brains out the back end, I was exhausted. I couldn’t stay awake and I couldn’t keep any food in my system. I ended up calling it during lunch at Hermana Crespo’s. She made me drink this steaming hot lemonade, acid-like concoction. It was so gross. I don’t think it helped.

We spent the rest of the day Thursday and also yesterday mostly in the house. It sucked. New Year’s was interesting. We played a lot of Monopoly Deal and had a devotional over zoom. We played more Monopoly Deal and had some popcorn. The countdown was fun, fireworks were going off everywhere. All the monegotes were out, but it started pouring rain. Like dumping. We saw one monegote explode from our window which was awesome. 

> Monegotes are these paper mache statues that people make for the New Year’s countdown. They are usually made to look like superheroes, cartoon characters, famous people, or other random stuff. It’s pretty fun to see all of the different creations. At midnight on New Year’s, they put them all in the street and them cover them in gasoline to blow them up. The tradition is that if you do a monegote one year, you have to do it for every year after that or else you’ll have bad luck the whole year. 

It’s a weird feeling, starting 2022 as my full mission year. I feel like I’m supposed to be here but I don’t think I’ve fully committed to life here. I want to make this year great, but how do I keep the motivation? I want to read this journal entry in a year and smile because I know I worked hard. I want to be proud of myself for how far I’ve come. Future Lincoln, I’m writing this in hopes that you’re proud of me right now. I have the desire, now I just need to trust in the things I know can strengthen me. I’m grateful for this year. Last year at this time, I wasn’t in a very good spot. I’m proud of the progress. I’m proud of the decisions I have made to get here. Let’s keep the ball rolling. 

Also, we had Sol Varela’s baptism on Thursday. It was nice. José baptized her. I love the baptismal words in Spanish too. 

I’ve learned a lot today. I talked to Mom and Dad and they told me that I needed to be sincere and honest with myself, but also with my companion. Elder Fig and I had a good talk about feeling bad for being sick and wanting to be a good missionary. Tonight I talked with Elder Boswell about setting goals and channeling excitement for the work and for the Gospel. I only have 20 months left.

## January 2, 2022

Finally a normal day. Feels so good. I played the piano at church which was funny because the congregation was not used to having an actual piano player. They were so off but it was fun. I also bore my testimony which felt really good. We ate with la familia Jordan too and it was real good. They had hot sauce, which nobody ever has here. We went to Montalvo again today with Crespito, Jennifer Jordan, Nefi Martinez, y Hermano Fajardo <span class="custom-tooltip">como siempre<span class="tooltip-text">like always</span></span>. It was nice. Crespito is one funny dude. I can never understand him but he reminds me of Bunda. Poops were solid today so all thumbs up there.

## January 3, 2022

Evangelicas are crazy man. We were trying to teach Daniel today, but first, his Mom had to try and flame us for 20 min, clapping at us and telling us we were going to go to hell. Super cool. But the lesson went well so that’s chevere. A wasp flew into my collar today and into my shirt and then magically disappeared… that was cool. Good day today though. Long, as always, but good. 

> Evangelicos were just like really aggressive Baptists most of the time. They liked really flashy church meetings and usually met on weekday evenings, about the time we usually would be walking around. They enjoyed telling us why we were going to hell. The wasp thing was also memorable, I really don’t understand how it got out. I felt it fly down my collar and I heard it buzzing around inside my shirt between my garment top and shirt. I jumped up and started yelling that it was in my shirt so the family let me go into the back to take my shirt off and get it out but when I took off my shirt, nothing. It was gone. I don’t know what happened to it but that wasp disappeared.

I was showing la familia Coronel pictures of the family and they were saying how Ellis looked way older than she was… Kinda weird, but also funny.

## January 4, 2022

Pretty average day. I am tired. But tomorrow is pday. That is hype. Also contacted a bunch in La Maritza today. 

## January 5, 2022

DIA DE P!!! Was good today. Didn’t do much this evening but I was super happy to talk to the family. I wanted to write a copy of what I wrote to myself a year ago: 

Dear Lincoln,

This is a funny letter to write. Writing this letter on January 3rd, 2021. I have no possible idea where you will be in a year. I can only hope for one thing and that is that you are fully immersed in whatever it is that you are doing. You have a lot to be grateful for. Make it happen dude. 

Sincerely, 
    Lincoln 

I also feel that I should copy what Dad wrote me: “It’s a good reminder of how quickly things can change. These people you’re teaching, it might feel like a big move for them to embrace the gospel. But in as little as a year, they could have a completely new life – changed forever for the better.” What I am doing right now is the most important thing I could possibly be doing. This is why I am here. To help people experience the true joy that comes from embracing the Gospel. Not the church itself. Not the members. The Gospel of Jesus Christ. This is the most important work on the Earth and I am humbled and honored to be a part of it. 

## January 6, 2022

We did a bunch of contacting in Montalvo today. Tiring, but good. Found some cool new people and worked hard. I don’t know if it feels like I’m in Ecuador. It’s beautiful here though, and the language is coming along, slowly but surely. We kicked a rock all the way home, probably a couple miles worth. Pretty swag. 

> I don’t know why I said that. That’s so cringy. 

## January 7, 2022

Zone Conference over Zoom today. Felt like a filibuster at times but it’s always nice to spend some time just sitting and listening. We visited Hermana Marcia today. Pretty sad to see people mourning the loss of a loved one. We taught a bunch today too, which was good, just tiring. I felt frustrated with my Spanish. I need to stop comparing myself to people and I think sometimes my desire to progress rapidly impedes my actual progress because I can get frustrated quicker. I’ll work on that. 

## January 8, 2022

We tested negative for COVID yay! It was one of those deep nose tests too. <span class="custom-tooltip">Feísimo.<span class="tooltip-text">So nasty.</span></span> So we got to go to Montalvo for a few hours. It was pretty great, we taught Hermana Mongoli and she’s gonna come with us to church tomorrow! We have to take the bus over there at like 9:00 so we can accompany her to church because she doesn’t know Babahoyo very well. I’m excited. We aalso taught the neighbors of Hermano Fajardo, which went well. I corrected one girl’s English homework, which was funny because the whole worksheet was riddled with errors, not her errors, but the questions themselves. Like, “True or False. Fire is dangerous then water.” Very funny. 

> I remember teaching the Fajardo’s neighbors. They were actually super rude to us and I think they really liked teasing the missionaries. They also really liked that I was a innocent white kid. The girl with the homework was flirting the whole time but I had no idea. I just thought the English homework was funny. 

## January 10, 2022

Yesterday, Hermana Magaly came to church with her family and her kids. It was so cute to see them come out of their humble little home all dressed. We were super late because the buses to and from Montalvo were running late, but I think they liked church. 

> This was the cutest family ever. Her kids were all dressed nicely and hair done and they were all so excited. They lived really far so it was incredible they wanted to go with us. They lived in a tiny little wooden hut next to the river. I didn’t quite realize it at the time, but it was a huge miracle they came with us that day.

Jeremy Yepez was there as well, who we visited today. He was super excited about being baptized, we still just need to ask the Mom permission. 

We finally bought a new fan today, after Figueroa broke ours with a soccer ball Saturday night. We have been sleeping next to the window out front two nights now. The mosquitos love it I’m sure. We also heard like 12 gunshots last night. Gotta love Babahoyo.

> That night we slept by the window with the gunshots, I was looking trying to see if I could see anything on the street and Figueroa was freaking out that I was gonna get shot if I even looked out. He was probably right to be a little nervous but I thought it was really funny that he was so concerned I was about to get sniped from the window. We all slept in one room for one of those nights. Elder Boswell and Elder Torres were nice enough to share their fan with us. We were big fans of “mega bed”.

## January 11, 2022

Today was kind of a wake up call for me. I was feeling all depressy about worrying if I’m working hard or not but once again I had a good talk with Elder Figueroa about it. I was doubting myself and my motivation for being here. I need to be more patient with myself. 

In other news, I trapped two <span class="custom-tooltip">grillos<span class="tooltip-text">crickets</span></span> on my desk under plastic cups and somehow they both escaped… Not going to be so nice the next time…

## January 12, 2022

‘Twas a swell Dia de Pey, because I bought a guitar! It’s not terrible and not great, but for $177 it’ll be just fine. I got all the necessary accessories too. Super swaggy. 

This guitar actually was a huge mood boost throughout my entire mission. I still have it. It’s a crap guitar but it sounded like heaven to me.

## January 13, 2022

Pretty swell day today. It rained a lot so it felt soooo good outside. We went to Montalvo too, which is always great. We taught Hermana Gloria and her daughter Paulina the Restoration and it was really awesome and spiritual. She told us that she knew we were servants of the Lord. She also told us after the lesson that she believed Michael Jackson was of the devil and has horns and could shoot fire out of his fingers. 

## January 14, 2022

Well it’s happening again… The whole house quarantined today because Bozz (Boswell), Torres, and Fig are pretty sick. Fig did not look well the whole day and was running a pretty solid fever. I got some good studies in and we played cards a lot today so that was fun. Otherwise a pretty boring day. I feel great which kind of is poor timing. We’re getting tested tomorrow for Covid again so I guess we’ll find out. I’m gonna keep working hard and doing what I can no matter what happens. 

Also, found out last night that I’ve been drinking unfiltered water since I got here so that’s probably why I crapped my pants a couple weeks ago. Love Ecuador! I just now realized that even after I filled my pants, I was drinking unfiltered water for a couple weeks. I guess my stomach had hardened at that point. 

> There it is, the day of realization.

## January 15, 2022

OK this time it really did happen. We all have Covid! Well technically all of us except for me. I think it’s because I have been strengthening my body by drinking unfiltered water. Figueroa was not doing well again today. I gave him a blessing which was in Spanish obviously, but the weird thing was that it felt like English. Anyways, we’re going to have to quarantine until Wednesday, so lots of <span class="custom-tooltip">videollamadas<span class="tooltip-text">video calls</span></span>, card games, and studying awaits me! 

## January 16, 2022

Yay more quarantine! Not much to write, we played lots of cards.

## January 17, 2022

<span class="custom-tooltip">Quiero morir.<span class="tooltip-text">I want to die.</span></span>

> I didn’t actually get sick during the whole quarantine, it was just brutal being in the house all day. I hated doing cold calls and it was just like torture to not be able to do anything. I read and studied a lot. 

## January 18, 2022

Ughhhhhhh. Ecuador is in the red zone for Covid now. We’ll see what happens. For now just focusing on Spanish and working out. Yayyyy. 

## January 19, 2022

Today, the best thing I did was buy a candle. It’s so awesome. I finished my study on motivation for missionaries too. It was really cool. I actually learned a lot and had fun doing it. I also learned that the Spirit can give us revelation through self-reflective questions, promptings to act, and summarizing statements. I think I’m going to try and study in that way from now on. 

## January 20, 2022

The son of Crespito told me today that I’m a cool gringo.

## January 21, 2022

Today we made visits with Fricson and Steven (<span class="custom-tooltip">hijo de Crespito<span class="tooltip-text">Crespito's son</span></span>). It was pretty cool. Missionary work is fun today and I could feel myself progressing. We almost put someone on date, but then she was like, “I’m already baptized!” We were like, “awwww man”, so we’lll have to return again and explain that. But good day. Dad added Lauren Dangle to my drive so that was dope. 

> Lauren Daigle was this Christian singer that Elder Boswell listened to. Her last name was more fun to say as “dangle” so I used that more often. 

## January 24, 2022

I feel like some days I feel really good and some are just way harder. Today felt a lot harder. I guess that’s just life. A lady told us she thought that evil spirits were making love with her in the nighttime. Never have had to explain that one before. 

## January 26, 2022

Kind of a bummer/cool Pday today. We had to go to Guayaquil to get vaccinations, which we thought would be the third dose of Covid but turned out to be flue. It was nice to see the district though. We’ve been kind of shut down so I haven’t really had the opportunity to talk with any of them. It was also good to meet more Elders in the mission. The assistants have to spend some time in Guayaquil so we have the house to ourselves until Saturday. 

## January 27, 2022

Got my first taste of Latin American futbol today. Ecuador played Brazil in the world cup qualifiers today and we just so happened to be eating lunch near a TV when they were playing (hehehe). We tied, but should’ve won, we should’ve had a penalty during extra time but VAR denied it. Makes me super excited to be here in Ecuador for Mundial (“World Cup”) in November. 

Also today during lunch, Steven put his hand on my shoulder and then squeezed my <span class="custom-tooltip">chichi<span class="tooltip-text">boob</span></span>, Fig and I were dying. He’s <span class="custom-tooltip">medio raro<span class="tooltip-text">kinda weird</span></span> but a funny dude. Mini Crespito. 

## January 29, 2022

Had a good little (1.5 hrs) visit with Hermana Gloria today. She has a lot of questions but she’s super close to a baptismal date so that’s exciting. 

Also sad news today… Elder Boswell is leaving. He’s gonna continue as the new assistant and Elder Torres will likely stay here. We will find out more specifics during transfers next week, but we’ll be getting a new roommate. I’ll be sad to see Elder Boswell go though. He’s taught me a lot about the motivation for missionary work and that joy comes through diligence. Most happy, obedient, faithful missionary I’ve met. Love that dude. 

> Elder Boswell helped my mission really start out on the right foot. I remember plenty of late night talks about what it really means to be a missionary and how to be happy in the work. He was really genuine with me and helped me feel that my feelings were valid. That meant a lot to me. I’ll be forever grateful for his example.

## January 30, 2022

Well Bawz-man left today. I’m really grateful for that guy. He taught me a lot about what happy missionary work looks like. If I can be anywhere near what he is as a missionary, I will be overjoyed. Elder Figueroa and I are gonna stay here but as far as the rest of the <span class="custom-tooltip">cambios<span class="tooltip-text">transfers</span></span> go, we’ll find out on Wednesday. It was nice to go back to in-person church today too. I’m excited for this next transfer, I really want to get my footing in the work. I’ve had so much change in the first quarter of my mission, I’m just ready to get into the daily grind.

Put Esnaider on date today and also had a lesson with this really interesting dude. Half of his face was sunken because he got in a motorcycle accident 4 years ago. He was in a coma for 1.5 months. Really good lesson though and he’ll be at church on Sunday so that’s dope.

> Esnaider was a member’s little brother who reminded me a lot of Will. He was a little harder to teach because he didn’t pay attention too well (no offense Will) but he did like going to church and had lots of friends there. I kind of thought of him as my little brother.

I gave the training today in district council. It was on Zoom but it went well I think. I talked about how to develop Christ-like attributes. We also went out to Puertas Negras with Steven and Fricson today. It was pretty good, we met lots of people and I think it was good for the two of them as well. 

> Puertas Negras was the notoriously dangerous spot of our area, if not all Babahoyo. We always heard about shootings and muggings there.

Chevere Pday. Bought a bunch of food, got all of our hairs cut and contacted.

Kind of odd but cool day. We went to Montalvo to visit Mariela and had a really good talk with her about attending church. We were talking about how sacrifice is part of faith and it was really spiritual. She also apparently dreamed about me? She dreamt I was at church with her, kind of weird but if that’s what it takes to get her to church… We also had a good little chat with Gloria. We’re so close with her too, they both just need to take that little step. 

Then we had to get back to Babahoyo for a baptismal interview for the Hermanas and the kid, Mathias, kind of randomly wants me to baptize him! Never met the kid before but I’ll be honored to do it. 

> Mariela had a strange attachment to me. We taught her a lot more after Elder Figueroa left, but this was just the start. 

> As for Mathias, whenever we did interviews for the sister missionaries we had to ask the person being baptize if they had someone that they would like to baptize them. It was generally a little awkward because if they didn’t already have someone, they had to pick between the two of us. Mathias was shy, but when it came to who was going to baptize him, he wanted me to do it. I presume it was because I was a tall, white person, which made me intriguing.

<span class="custom-tooltip">Un día loco.<span class="tooltip-text">A crazy day.</span></span> We had a bunch of lessons today. One girl told me that when I speak English, <span class="custom-tooltip">“suena rico”<span class="tooltip-text">sounds delicious, literally</span></span>, someone asked me if my hair was natural, and an Evangelical had a “vision” for us. I tried to ask him a question and he paused and then kept ranting about <span class="custom-tooltip">Santiago<span class="tooltip-text">James</span></span> and <span class="custom-tooltip">Juan<span class="tooltip-text">John</span></span> and random stuff. The new elders arrived today too. Elder Richins and Elder Howard. They both seem very tired and nervous. Makes me think back to my first days. Good reminder that I need to be a good example. I’m gonna have a great transfer. Also, I’m going to baptize Esnaider! Super chevere. 

## February 5, 2022

Good day today, we worked hard. Contacted a lot, which can be pretty exhausting. Got to spend a little time with Jose the <span class="custom-tooltip">Viejito<span class="tooltip-text">little old guy</span></span>, the insanely healthy 90 year old that just walks in front of motorcycles and stuff. Dude is the subject. This guy was so funny. He was so old but he moved so well for his age. 

> The sentence “dude is the subject” is straight from Spanish. Calling someone “the subject” was like saying, “he’s the main character”, or something along those lines. 

We’re hoping for a good turnout at church tomorrow too. Also got to baptize Mathias for the Hermanas de Lindo tonight. It was really cool. He started to cry during pictures because he felt the Spirit. But all went well, I said the words right and it was a happy occasion.

Ugh, I haven’t been able to sleep well. Today was hard. I was super exhausted. We visited leaders with Crespito which was funny to see him jump over puddles and stuff. We also had an interesting encounter with a very drunk dude. He told me that “we kill people here in Ecuador” and then his brother asked (kind of robbed) me for money. Probably not going to tell Mom that though.

> Hermano Crespo, or "Crespito", was the ward mission leader and would go out with us all the time. He was very dedicated to the work and sacrificed a lot of time. He had this funny, kind of raspy voice that was hard to understand, but he made lots of sarcastic jokes and liked to poke missionaries’ bellies.

## February 7, 2022

We taught some pretty direct lessons today, one to Mariuxi and one to Gloria. At Mariuxi’s in the morning I cut my fist open on a bottle cap, but we were pretty straightforward with her on getting to church so that was good. Same with Gloria, we brought Hermana Guashpa and she was awesome. I didn’t know how Glorio didn’t kick Adolfo out of the house already but we taught both. Now just have to cross fingers and hope they get to church. Ughhh Babahoyo. 

Also, another guy took (robbed kinda) my last five cents. Good day though. I was telling Elder Fig today that my life in the United States is starting to feel like a dream. I feel like I’ve only ever lived here in Ecuador. Weird. 

> I think I should add a little context to Gloria. She lived way up in the back part of Montalvo in this tiny little house. She had a billion dogs, chickens, cats, and even a goose. She was kind of a psycho, she would breastfeed her 6 year old son right in front of us and often times hit her children too. Her husband was abusive and cheated on her all the time, which is why I mentioned I was surprised she hadn’t kicked him out. They were super poor and had no money to go by bus to church, which is why they never came. She was kind of funny though and she really liked when we would teach her.
